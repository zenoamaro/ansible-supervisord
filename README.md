Usage
-----
Clone this repo into your roles directory:

And add it to your play's roles:

    - hosts: ...
      roles:
        - supervisord

      vars:
        supervisor_programs:
          - name: ping
            command: ping -i 10 localhost
            autostart: true
            autorestart: true
        supervisor_events:
          - name: crashmail
            command: crashmail -p program -m alerts@localhost
            events: PROCESS_STATE_EXITED
        supervisor_groups:
          - name: my_group
            programs: ping

This roles comes preloaded with almost every available default. You can override each one in your hosts/group vars, in your inventory, or in your play. See the annotated defaults in `defaults/main.yml` for help in configuration. All provided variables start with `supervisord_` or `supervisorctl_`.

You can also use the role as a playbook. You will be asked which hosts to provision, and you can further configure the play by using `--extra-vars`.

    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory --extra-vars='{...}' main.yml

Run the tests by provisioning the appropriate VM:

    $ vagrant up test-ubuntu-trusty

At the moment, the following test boxes are available:

- `test-ubuntu-precise`
- `test-ubuntu-trusty`


Still to do
-----------
- Add tasks for quickly creating supervisor programs
- Support for fastcgi programs, event listeners, ...
